# CitasV2

A platform for remote data collection, data storage, and a data analysis framework that uses web, mobile, and cloud technologies for the detection and forecasting of plant diseases. 

The web platform is accessible to researchers who wish to acquire data gathered by the farmers and analyzed by the system.

## Soil Analysis

Soil parameters gathered from the field are plotted on a graph to show the trends over a given time period.

## Geospatial Analysis & Disease Mapping

The web platform visualizes the spread of Foc TR4 in the respective farm sites and analyze where the disease might spread to next.

## Plant Image Analysis

Images loaded into the system are processed and analyzed to see if the plants are infected with Foc TR4 or not.
