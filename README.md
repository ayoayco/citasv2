## Frequently Asked Questions

*Q:* How do I update the API Base URL?
*A:* All the communication with the backend API are handled by the Angular Service: citas.api.service.ts. The API base URL is stored in a variable in this file.

*Q:* What are the third-party libraries used?
*A:* A list of third-party libraries can be found (and should be updated everytime a new library is needed) in the meta file: .angular-cli.json. This file is used to gather all scripts used when the app is built.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
