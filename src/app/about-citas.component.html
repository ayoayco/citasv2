            <p class="about-content">
                The project aims to address the problem of late detection of diseases in plants by developing an intelligent and mobile cloud-based Total Analysis System (TAS) consisting of a mobile PlantScope (mobile phone based microscope) partnered with a mobile loop-mediated
                isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay kit that will be directly accessible to farmers. </p>
            <p class="about-content">
                We want to provide a platform for remote data collection, data storage, and a data analysis framework that uses web, mobile, and cloud technologies in the context of detection and prediction of plant disease and its spread, respectively.
            </p>
            <p class="about-content">
                The project also provides low-cost environmental monitoring of crops that uses a multi-dimensional (plant, its environment, and geospatial features) and multi-platform approach (using web, mobile, and cloud), considering micro-total analysis and a relatively
                low cost mobile lab.
